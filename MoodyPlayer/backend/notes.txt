Jo music humm upload krr rahe hai 
uska mood kya hoga - happy , sad , neutral

usko store karege - cloud mai , S3 mai because our prod server dosent have 
any Memory in it 

it has only OS , number of CPU and its RAM 

we dont have ssd or secondary memory 

production server dosent have secondary memory so for that 
we can use cloud service providers 

WHAT IS A CLOUD STORAGE SERVICE : 
it allows users to store data on remote servers over the internet 
rather than on their own physical devices 

and will give a url through which we can access it 

imagekit : A CLOUD STORAGE PROVIDER , great for things under 10mb 
bunny : great for video 

we cant store songs in mongo db as it will cost more 
but for imagekit it is comparitively cheaper 
its not practicle or cheaper  

MongoDB alag hai its a DB organised for fast read write speeds 
not to store large amout of Data 

where as cloud storage providers are used to store large files , reading them 

imagekit pe jaake songs ko store karna hoga :
audio files ko image kit pe store karna hai 
voh url dega that we will store in db and using that we will be able to access the songs 

STORING SONGS
/*
    title 
    artist 
    audioFile
    
    agar sirf title and artist hote toh hum raw format mai bhej dete 
    
    but since we also want to send and audio_file uss mai we cant share files 
    we need to send it in the form of form-data 

    raw format is optimised for raw object data using less resources 
    but in passing files we need to use form data which would need much more resources on the server side
    we can send any type of data 

    in form data we can share multiple data like texts and files 
    where as in binary we can share only files 

    in case of raw data we will use express.json()
    but in case of form data we will use multer 
*/

MULTER FILE UPLOAD 
jo hamara multer hai yeh jo form data form mai data aaye ga humm usse read krr paaye 
yeh jo file aa rahi hai iska memory storage mai store krr lena 
memory storage: server ki ram (temporary server ki ram mai store ho jaaye ga )

const upload = multer({storage:multer.memoryStorage()});


songs ko upload karna in DB : it is similar to app.post()
multer is applied as a middleware and pass the name of the key where you will send the data 

IN case of muptiple files we will write Array 

// files -> postman ->imagekit->url in return (we can use this to acess it )
//songs ko upload karna in DB : it is similar to app.post()
//multer is applied as a middleware and pass the name of the key where you will send the data 

router.post("/songs", upload.single("audio"), async (req, res) => {
    try{
        // to see our text data 
        console.log("Text data:", req.body);
        
        // to see our file data 
        console.log("File data:", req.file);

        //upload the file to image kit 
        const fileData = await uploadFile(req.file);

        //image kit jo result dega voh idhar hoga 
        console.log("ImageKit response:", fileData);

        res.status(201).json({
            message: "Song uploaded successfully",
            url: fileData.url,
        });

    }catch(error){
        console.error("Upload failed:", error);
        res.status(500).json({ message: "Upload failed", error });
    }
});

Integrating FRONTEND WITH BACKEND
how its done ? 

user jab bhi button pe click karega 

Face Api : will detect user mood , user ka mood detect hone ke baad 
then our BACKEND api will be called ki user ka mood happy hai happy wala song laake do 
user ka mood sad hai sad waale songs laake do, user ka mood neutral hai voh waale songs laake do 

// HOW WE ARE GONNA DO THAT 
how we will integrate it : 
With the help of axios we will be sending request on our backend 

we used state in which we sent songs to mood songs so that 
waha se humm songs show krr paaye 

and we sent setSongs to facial expression cuz that will check aur face 
expression and then will send data to backend will fetch the songs and then 
inject their value in songs state variable 

HOW WE ARE GOING TO DO API REQUEST BETWEEN OUR FRONTEND AND SERVER 
1) Axios : to send request to backend from frontend 
   and jo request aaye ga usse set krr do 

WE NEED TO SET UP CORS POLICY : 
jis api pe hum request krr rahe the it has been blocked 
frontend se jo request backend pe jaa rahi hai usse block krr diya hai CORS Policy ki wajah se 

CORS POLICY KA MATLAB : humme kisi website ke resources use karne se prevent karta hai 
agar dono ke origin alag alag hai then they cant communicate or share resources

How to fix it ?
backend pe ek middleware rakho cors naam ka
